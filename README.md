# Welcome

This is a terminal based 2 D game in Python3 (terminal-based), heavily inspired by Clash of clans where the user will control the king, move it up, down, forward and backward. Concepts of object oriented programming are used in this.

It uses the following OOPS concepts.

```
Inheritance: One Building class is present
Polymorphism: In spell class
Encapsulation: Class Object based ideology is used
Abstraction: Intuitive functionality like move(), attack() etc  methods are within the class.
```



## Instructions to run the game

```
w- Move up
a- Move left
s- Move down
d- Move right
l- Leviathan attack
1 or 2 or 3- to spawn barbarians
r- rage spell
h- heal spell
Note that we have to avoid capslock

To run the file cd into the directory and then run
 python3 game.py
To run replay use
 python3 replay.py
In the replays folder all the necessary replays will be stored.
```

Any game that has been played is available as a replay.

Each game  ends in either victory or defeat.
○ Victory: All buildings (excluding walls) have been destroyed.
○ Defeat: All troops and the King have died without destroying all buildings.
